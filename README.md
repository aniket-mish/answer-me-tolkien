# toy-rag

This is a simple RAG application built using langchain and chroma database.

1. Store the api key in the .env file.

2. Create a database
`python create_db.py`

3. Query the system
`python query_db.py`

I have used cohere's embedding and the chat model.

I have used lotr scripts as the source data.
